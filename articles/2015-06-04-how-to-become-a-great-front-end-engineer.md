A few days ago a received an email that, while very short and open-ended, for whatever reason it really got me thinking. Here's what it said:

> Hi Philip, is it okay to ask how you become a great front-end engineer?
> Any advice?

There have been a number of posts on this subject over the years, but I wanted this one to have a different spin. Most of the existing posts focus on the technologies you should know and the tools you should be using.

In this post I'm not going to talk about what you should know to become a good front-end engineer, and I'm to talk about how you should think (or at least how I think you should think).

## Key Points

- Read other people's code.
- Work with people smarter than you.
- Build things for fun.
- Reinvent the wheel.
- Write about what you learn.
- Realize that the people you think are better than you are just people, and they probably think that too.
- Realize that some people actually are just better than you.
- Practice interviewing by actually going on interviews.
