A few days ago a received an email that, while very short and open-ended, for whatever reason it really got me thinking. Here's what it said:

> Hi Philip, is it okay to ask how you become a great front-end engineer?
> Any advice?

There have been a number of posts on this subject over the years, but I wanted this one to have a different spin. Most of the existing posts focus on the technologies you should know and the tools you should be using.

In this post I'm not going to talk about what you should know to become a good front-end engineer, and I'm to talk about how you should think (or at least how I think you should think).

## Advice

- Don't just solve the problem, figure out what's really going on

    So many people who write CSS and JavaScript tinker until they find something that works, and then they just move on. This sometimes gets the job done, but it doesn't increase your knowledge or improve your craft. Take the time to figure out why your solution worked.

- Learn to anticipate future changes to the platform

    The main difference between front-end and back-end code is back-end code generally runs on a platform that is completely under your control. The front-end, by contrast, is completely outside of your control. The user's platform or device could completely change at any moment, and your code needs to be able to handle it gracefully.

    Do not write code that requires a particular environment to work -- eventually that environment will be replaced with something else.

- Read the specs

    There will always be browser bugs, and when two browser render the same code differently, people too often assume that the so-called "good" browser is right and the "bad" browser is wrong. But this isn't always the case, and when you're wrong about this assumption whatever workaround you choose will almost certainly break in the future.

    If you take the time to understand what's supposed to happen and code with that in mind, your work will last much longer.

- Read other people's code

    Reading other people's code for fun is almost never my idea of a good time, but doing so is probably the single best way to get better.

    Solving problems on your own is extremely valuable, but when you do that all you have is your current knowledge set, and so you'll tend to solve problems in very similar ways.

    Reading other people's code opens your mind to knew ways of doing things.

- Work with people smarter than you

    Freelancing is the dream for a lot of people, but it's an easy way to plateau your skills. Luckily we live in an age where "working with people" isn't limited to your day job. Get involved in open source projects that interest you to keep pushing yourself forward.

- Write about what you learn

    In my experience, the best way to learn something is to try to teach it to someone else. It forces you to really understand it in a way that simply using it never does.

- Reinvent the wheel

    Reinventing the wheel is bad for business, but it's great for learning. jQuery probably makes you far more productive that you were without it, but imagine how much more you'd learn trying to make your own version.

    Don't take this too far though, as well-established libraries have the advantage of years of bug reports that you're probably not aware of off the top of your head.

- Build things for fun

    Everyone I know who excels as a front-end engineer loves doing their job in the free time as well. This isn't so much a piece of advice as it is a warning sign. If you don't love what you do, there's probably zero chance of ever being great. And that probably applies to every profession, not just web development.
