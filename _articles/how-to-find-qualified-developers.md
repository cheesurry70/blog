Everyone knows a good developers is hard to find. You hear this complaint constantly, even from the big companies that.


Basic Strategy:

* Think of open source projects that you either use, like, or that impress you in some way.
* There's a good chance that you won't be able to hire the creator or creators of those projects. They're likely well known in the industry and everyone is trying to get them.
* What you want to do is hire the contributors to those project. Those are people who obviously write code well enough to get pull requests accept to big-name projects, yet they're probably relatively unknown.
