Everyone knows a good developers is hard to find. Companies complain about this constantly, even the big ones. But in my experience this complaint isn't so much about the lack of good developers; rather, its about the ratio of qualified to unqualified.

Before I applied for my previous job, my company interviewed literally dozens of candidates, all of them not qualified. It was getting to the point where they were considering hiring two less than idea candidates with complementary skill sets just to fill the one role.

I think this is pretty common at a lot of web companies today. Especially for front-end roles since front-end technologies aren't taught in school and it's much harder to assess someone's qualifications from their resume.

The problem is not that companies don't know what to look for, it's that they don't know where to look.

Before I left my previous company, our CTO pulled me aside and asked me for advice on how to go about looking for my replacement. In Santa Barbara there are always plenty of new computer science graduates each year out of USCB, but hiring someone for front-end stuff (or really any specialty) takes a more dedicated search. As I'm sure most hiring managers have experienced, it's not good enough to just post the job to all the usual places and hope the right person comes along.

## Where To Look

I spent a bit of time thinking about my CTO's question. How *would* I go about hiring my replacement if it were up to me?

Do I personally know any really good front-end developers? No, not really. All of the front-end people I know are people who are prominent in the industry. In other words, people who are probably not looking for new jobs, and even if they were are probably not going to want to work for some company they've never heard of.

So where are all the other good front-end developers?

### Look At Your Stack

When I started thinking about the best developer I knew, I realized all of those people were creators of popular open source projects. And that's when it hit me.

Duh.

Every single open source project has one or more creators, but it also has a myriad of contributors. And those are the people we should be hiring.

## The Strategy

Look at your current tech stack. Think about the open source tools you use. Are you a Rails shop? Do you use Backbone or Ember? Does your build process involve Grunt? What third party gems, plugins, or libraries do you use?

If your goals is to find someone who will ultimately write code in this environment, who better to hire than someone who has contributed to these project? And if the library is on Github, this couldn't be any easier.

Imagine you're about to build a new app and you want to use Backbone.js on the front-end. There's a good chance you won't be able to hire Backbone's creator [Jeremy Ashkenas](https://github.com/jashkenas), but the project isn't just him. There are over 200+ contributors.

On Github you can click on the contributors link and it (by default) sorts them by how much they've contributed to the project. There's a pretty good chance that anyone in the top 5 is a great developer who is far more qualified to write Backbone code than anyone on your team, so why not reach out?

## Win Win

The more I think about this strategy the more its implications. If more companies started hiring people based on their open source contributions, it would be a huge win for the open source community.

The motivation to contribute to popular projects would increase tremendously, and everyone would benefit from that.

Another problem this might help solve is the current trend towards reinventing the wheel. A lot of people are building brand new software instead of contributing to improve existing solutions simply because there's currently not a lot of glory in contributions.

## Considerations

Obvious this shouldn't be your only hiring strategy as not everyone has the time or means to contribute to open source software. A candidate who works multiple jobs to pay the bills should obviously not be penalized or unfairly judged for a lack of open source contributions. That being said, if you're actively looking for a particular type of developer, it's impossible to judge people who have nothing to show for.
