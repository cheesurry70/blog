Finding a good developer is hard.

People constantly complain about how few qualified applicants they receive. They post their job openings in every known job listing. They hire recruiters to scour Linkedin. They do all of this in the hopes that a bigger stack of resumes will yield at least one hire who is up to their standards.

The obvious problem with this firehouse strategy is that it doesn't improve the quality of your applicants, it's simply playing the numbers. More resumes just ends up meaning more time spent considering people you'll never hire. And if you're like most companies, you don't have that kind of time.

The best way to hire qualified developers isn't to hope they come to you, it's to go out and find them.

In the rest of this article I outline a strategy I recently recommended to a friend who's been struggling to find good front-end engineers. Hopefully this technique can help others make their next hires too.

## Open Source

Every company I know of prefers employee recommendations to just about any other recruiting method. And for good reason. Referrals are such a great option because they eliminate so many unknowns upfront. Somebody on your team vouches for the skill of someone they know, and at that point interviewing is almost just a formality.

The problem is not everyone knows other good developers, and at most companies (especially small ones) you run out of referrals pretty quickly.

The technique I recommend is aims to take all the best aspects of personal referrals without requiring first-hand knowledge. In short, you need to find people whose abilities are already proven.

How? Simple. Look for contributors on Github.

## The Strategy

Companies will often check out a candidates open source contributions during the interview process, and that's fine, but I think this is still too passive.

Companies should be using Github not just for vetting but for recruiting.

If you're a web company, you probably use a lot of open source software in your stack. And since the software is open source, you can see not only the code itself but who wrote it.

Now, I'm sure maybe of you have considering trying to hire the creators of popular open source libraries, but in truth, unless you're a big name company you probably won't be able to do that.

Guys like John Resig, DHH, and Jeremy Ashkenas are basically off the market. And even if they were looking, they're probably not going to go work for some company they've never heard of.

But the creators aren't the only people who make open source software. There's also the contributors. Millions of them!

Think about it. Do you use Node, Rails, or Django on the back-end? Do you use Angular, Ember, or Backbone for the client? If so, why not reach out to one of the contributors? Do you need someone who knows the various browser quicks? Find a jQuery, Bootstrap or Foundation contributor.

No matter what type of person you're trying to hire, there's an open source project with plenty of contributors who reflect those particular skills.

## Why Contributors?

At first it may seem like recruiting a library contributor is like buying an off brand version of the real thing. But if you ask me, a prolific, open source contributor is in many ways more valuable than the creator of the libraries they contribute to.

After all, anyone who's made substantial contribution to an open source project has not only demonstrated their ability to write coherent code, but more importantly they've also demonstrated their ability to read, process, and improve upon the code someone else has written.

That second part is arguably much more valuable, especially on a large team with an existing codebase.

Being a contributor is essentually what an employee is. So the ability to contribute is probably one of the hardest qualities to assess in an interview.

## Win Win

The more I think about this strategy the more I like its implications. If more companies started hiring people based on their open source contributions, it would be a huge win for the open source community.

The motivation to contribute to popular projects would increase tremendously, and everyone would benefit from that.

Another problem this might help solve is the current trend towards reinventing the wheel. A lot of people are building brand new software instead of contributing to improve existing solutions simply because there's currently not a lot of glory in contributions.

## Considerations

Obviously this shouldn't be your only hiring strategy as not everyone has the time or means to contribute to open source software. A candidate who works multiple jobs to pay the bills should obviously not be penalized or unfairly judged for a lack of open source contributions. That being said, if you're actively looking for a particular type of developer, it's impossible to judge people who have nothing to show for.
