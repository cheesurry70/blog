1. CSS Methodologies shouldn't be about being pretty or elegant they should be about solving problems
   a. simple, "clean" class names
   b. readable, "elegant" pairings
2. The hardest problem in CSS
   a. writing selectors that match the elements you want without accidentally matching the elements you don't want.
   b. BEM is the only methodology that allows you to be 100% sure you won't have unintended side-effects.
3. Why other conventions fail
4. How BEM is side-effect free
5. Conclusion

      i. Yes, it's verbose and requires a lot of classes in the HTML
     ii. But the confidence you get when writing with just BEM is well worth the extra work.
    iii. Until the web platform evolves to support
