<p>My name is Philip Walton or <a href="http://twitter.com/philwalton">@philwalton</a> on Twitter. I'm a front end software engineer for <a href="http://appfolio.com/about">AppFolio</a>, a Santa Barbara based startup that builds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service"><acronym title="Software as a Service">SaaS</acronym></a> Web applications for small and medium sized businesses.</p>

<p>At AppFolio we develop and maintain several different large web applications, and we try to reuse and share as much of the code as we possibly can. As a result, I spend a lot of my time focusing on patterns for writing reusable and scalable code.</p>

<p>Working on large scale applications and with mostly back-end developers presents a unique set of challenges. This blog is where I write about what I learn.</p>
