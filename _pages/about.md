My name is Philip Walton or [@philwalton](http://twitter.com/philwalton) on Twitter. I'm a senior front-end software engineer for [AppFolio](http://appfolio.com/about), a Santa Barbara based startup that builds [SaaS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) Web applications for small and medium sized businesses.

At AppFolio we develop and maintain several different large web applications, and we try to reuse and share as much of the code as we possibly can. As a result, I spend a lot of my time focusing on patterns for writing reusable and scalable code.

Working on large scale applications and with mostly back-end developers presents a unique set of challenges. This blog is where I write about what I learn.
