Douglas Crockford describes JavaScript confliction of classical verses prototypal inheritance as:

> This &hellip; was intended to make the language seem more familiar to classically trained programmers, but &hellip; JavaScript's constructor pattern did not appeal to the classical crowd. It also obscured JavaScript's true prototypal nature. As a result, there are very few programmers who know how to use the language effectively.
