## The Problems

- Most companies didn't ask me any CSS questions. The few that did asked be extremely basic things that any web developer should know, back-end or front-end

- Most companies didn't ask me an questions about the DOM

- Most companies didn't ask me questions about browsers

The bottom line is that most of the time I was interviewing I felt like I was being asked questions that an academically trained computer science student would be much better suited to answer. The problem is, in my experience academically trained computer science graduates rarely know anything about front-end web developement

## The Confusion

### Front-end developement work is ambiguous

- At a small design shop, a front-end developer is usually someone who can turn a Photoshop mockup into HTML and CSS. In other words, it's a designer who also knows some code.

- At an agency, a front-end developer is usually someone who knows jQuery and DOM and can build an interactive user interface.

- At a web startup, a front-end developer is probably someone who has built or uses an MVC-style JavaScript framework. She is probably a very solid programmer and probably has a computer science degree.

The point is the term is ambiguous and can apply to someone who is very technical to someone who doesn't program at all.
