title: My Experience Interviewing as a Front-End Engineer

Over the past few months I've been casually looking for front-end jobs in the San Francisco. It's not that I hated my current job or my current company, but with the tech scene in Santa Barbara being so small, I never felt like I really know how good (or bad) of a developer I actually was. I decided to interview at some big name companies in the Bay Area just see how I would fare.

Throughout this whole process I sent inquires to, and had phone interviews with Google, Twitter, Rdio, Causes, Zoosk, and Chart.io. Of those I was invited to interview on-site with Google, Twitter, Causes, and Zoosk.

Before I go any further or into any more detail, I want to give a few disclaimers. First of all, I don't think it would be fair or professional for me to divulge which companies made me offers and which didn't. I'll simply say that I received more than one offer and more than one rejection, but that it's not really relevant to my overriding point. Secondly, I want to stress that I'm going to do my best to honor the privacy of these companies. I don't want to call any particular company out for doing bad things; instead, I want to point out concerning trends that I saw and offer my thoughts on them.

## My Experience

Overall, my experience was quite good. Interviewing at some of these big tech companies was not nearly as scary as some of the stories you might have heard. Everyone was nice, everyone was professional, and if I didn't know the answer to something, I never felt belittled.

That being said, based on my experience, the current ways Bay Area tech companies interview front-end engineers is fundamentally flawed.

If I were to ask a random sample of hiring managers how they'd assess the effectiveness of an interview for a front-end candidate, I'm sure I'd get a myriad of answers. But one point I'm sure everyone would agree upon is that the questions you ask should be questions that will be best answered by the most qualified candidates for the job. To put that another way, if a talented back-end engineer with little to no front-end experience can outshine a talented front-end engineer in your interview, you're probably asking the wrong questions.

That last sentence basically sum up my criticism of the interviews I had. All of the questions I was asked where logical puzzles, generic coding challenges, and algorithm design &mdash; all of which are important to a degree, but none of which help assess the quality of the applicants front-end skill set.

## What Was Missing

A front-end engineer, at it's most basic level, is someone who writes code that is run on the end user's device, usually a Web browser. In today's world this means someone who writes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or any of the various languages that compiles to these.

The difference between the general term "programmer" and specific term "font-end engineer" is simply the domain where one's knowledge exists. A superstar front-end engineer is probably also a superstar programmer, but the reverse is not necessarily the case (often not).  In order to call yourself a front-end engineer you have to have knowledge about the domain of languages that instruct Web browsers as well as the quirks and differences between various browsers in use. In addition, a front-end engineer must know the various APIs that browsers expose for access via these languages, e.g., the DOM, SVG, canvas, media queries, local storage, etc.

Knowing Ruby does not make someone a Rails developer; similarly, knowing JavaScript does not make someone a front-end engineer. If you don't understand the HTML, CSS, DOM, and how all of these pieces work together, then you are probably not a strong candidate for a front-end software engineering position.

However, in my experience, questions that assess a candidates knowledge of these various languages and API was surprisingly absent from my interviews.

I wasn't asked a single question about new HTML APIs, and many of the people interviewing me hadn't heard of some of the newer and more exciting APIs like Web Components.

I was asked almost no questions about CSS. The questions I was asked were so simple, any Web developer should know the answer (like the difference between inline and block, or how to make an ordered list of links appear side-by-side).

I was asked almost no questions about DOM or binding events to elements and nothing about the fact that older versions of IE implement event binding in a different way than newer browsers.

What I was asked a lot about is logical puzzles. Here are a few puzzles that exemplify my typical interview question:

- Write a function that takes two sorted lists of numbers and merges them into a single sorted list.
- Given an array of integers (positive or negative) find the sub-array with the largest sum.
- Determine if a given string is a palindrome.
- Given a large hash table whose keys are movie names and whose values are a list of actors in that movies, write a function to determine the [Bacon number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) of a particular actor.

I don't want to imply that there isn't value in asking these questions. Obviously these are all perfectly fine interview questions. The problem is each of them has nothing to do with front-end development. A typical computer science undergrad with absolutely no Web development experience could easily pass an interview consisting of only these types of questions.

## Possible Explanations

If you're the company doing the hiring, what are you really determining about these candidates? My suspicion is that most of them assumed that since I was applying for a front-end position; I must have ample front-end skill. They were just trying to make sure I was also a solid programmer. But if that's the case, it seems far too risky. Front-end skills are not one size fits all.

Another possibility is that these are the questions being asked because the company didn't have anyone qualified (or available) to ask sufficiently challenging front-end questions. Though I don't believe this to be the case for any of my interviews, it's a pretty easy scenario to imagine, especially at your typical small startup hiring its first front-end position. But again, there are much better solutions to this situations than simply avoiding all front-end questions.

## My Suggestions

## The Problems

- Most companies didn't ask me any CSS questions. The few that did asked be extremely basic things that any web developer should know, back-end or front-end

- Most companies didn't ask me an questions about the DOM

- Most companies didn't ask me questions about browsers

The bottom line is that most of the time I was interviewing I felt like I was being asked questions that an academically trained computer science student would be much better suited to answer. The problem is, in my experience academically trained computer science graduates rarely know anything about front-end web developement

## The Confusion

### Front-end developement work is ambiguous

- At a small design shop, a front-end developer is usually someone who can turn a Photoshop mockup into HTML and CSS. In other words, it's a designer who also knows some code.

- At an agency, a front-end developer is usually someone who knows jQuery and DOM and can build an interactive user interface.

- At a web startup, a front-end developer is probably someone who has built or uses an MVC-style JavaScript framework. She is probably a very solid programmer and probably has a computer science degree.

The point is the term is ambiguous and can apply to someone who is very technical to someone who doesn't program at all.

## My Advice

- Front-end candidates should be interviewed by at least one front-end team member. If you don't have a front-end team member, find someone you know and trust.

- Obviously topics like logic and algorithims are important, especially for some companies. But if you're interviewing for a front-end position, the majority of questions should focus on front-end technologies. In other words, make sure that most of your questions could be answered better by a good front-end developer than a good back-end developer.

- Treat front-end developers with the same amount or respect that you treat all of your developers. If you act like your front-end codebase is a necessary evil, then whoever you hire probably won't stay there for very long.
