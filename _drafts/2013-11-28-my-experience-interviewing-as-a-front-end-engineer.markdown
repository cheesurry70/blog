title: My Experience Interviewing as a Front-End Engineer

Over the past few months I've been casually looking for front-end jobs in the San Francisco. It's not that I hated my current job or my current company, but with the tech scene in Santa Barbara being so small, I never felt like I really know how good (or bad) of a developer I actually was. I decided to interview at some big name companies in the Bay Area just see how I would fare.

Throughout this whole process I sent inquires to, and had phone interviews with Google, Twitter, Rdio, Causes, Zoosk, and Chart.io. Of those I was invited to interview on-site with Google, Twitter, Causes, and Zoosk.

Before I go any further or into any more detail, I want to give a few disclaimers. First of all, I don't think it would be fair or professional for me to divulge which companies made me offers and which didn't. I'll simply say that I received more than one offer and more than one rejection, but that it's not really relevant to my overriding point. Secondly, I want to stress that I'm going to do my best to honor the privacy of these companies. I don't want to call anyone in particular out for doing bad things; instead, I want to point out concerning trends that I saw and offer my thoughts on them.


## The Problems

- Most companies didn't ask me any CSS questions. The few that did asked be extremely basic things that any web developer should know, back-end or front-end

- Most companies didn't ask me an questions about the DOM

- Most companies didn't ask me questions about browsers

The bottom line is that most of the time I was interviewing I felt like I was being asked questions that an academically trained computer science student would be much better suited to answer. The problem is, in my experience academically trained computer science graduates rarely know anything about front-end web developement

## The Confusion

### Front-end developement work is ambiguous

- At a small design shop, a front-end developer is usually someone who can turn a Photoshop mockup into HTML and CSS. In other words, it's a designer who also knows some code.

- At an agency, a front-end developer is usually someone who knows jQuery and DOM and can build an interactive user interface.

- At a web startup, a front-end developer is probably someone who has built or uses an MVC-style JavaScript framework. She is probably a very solid programmer and probably has a computer science degree.

The point is the term is ambiguous and can apply to someone who is very technical to someone who doesn't program at all.

## My Advice

- Front-end candidates should be interviewed by at least one front-end team member. If you don't have a front-end team member, find someone you know and trust.

- Obviously topics like logic and algorithims are important, especially for some companies. But if you're interviewing for a front-end position, the majority of questions should focus on front-end technologies. In other words, make sure that most of your questions could be answered better by a good front-end developer than a good back-end developer.

- Treat front-end developers with the same amount or respect that you treat all of your developers. If you act like your front-end codebase is a necessary evil, then whoever you hire probably won't stay there for very long.
